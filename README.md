# Portfolio-Website

Welcome to my first portfolio website

### Installing

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CloneTrooper66/Portfolio-Website.git
cd Portfolio-Website
```

2. **Install Live Server**:

```bash
It enables you to right-click an HTML document, and it runs a server for you and opens a browser window with the file in it. Any changes you make to the file causes the browser to reload and you can immediately see them
Once installed, it will show you a button on the bottom called “Go Live”. Press it and you have a Live Server.
```
